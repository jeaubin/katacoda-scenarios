# Use Cisco Genie to learn and verify your network

This Katacode training simulates a real life scenario of a network engineer.

A major obstacle faced by all network engineers is keeping their network
operational and healthy. Genie can help with that!

1) Take a snapshot of your network when your network is in good state

2) Re-take a snapshot periodically and compare with initial snapshot

3) When something changed, be alerted.

Genie provides multiple ways to do this; this training will demonstrate two ways:

1) Genie linux cli interacts with your devices and capture the state of it, all
without any programing knowledge. Just like any other linux command.

2) [RobotFramework](https://robotframework.org) with [Genie robot
library]((https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/robot/index.html)
is a great way to get started with automation.

RobotFramework is an English keyword based automation framework and we've added Genie
robot library to automate your network.
