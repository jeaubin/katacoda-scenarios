# Use Cisco Genie to learn and verify your network with RobotFramework

This Katacode training simulates a real life scenario of a Network engineer.

A major obstacle faced by all network engineers is keeping their network up and
running continuously. Genie can help with that!

1) Take a snapshot of your network when you know your network is in good state

2) Re-take a snapshot periodically and compare with initial snapshot

3) When something changed, be alerted.

Genie provides multiple ways to do this,  one of them is with
[RobotFramework](https://robotframework.org). RobotFramework is an English
keyword based automation framework, with a Genie Library to automate your
network.
