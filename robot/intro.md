# Introduction to Genie

Genie is a python library solution which contains all the tools needed for
Network Test Automation.

Genie comes for different type of folks:

1) I dont know python or automation,  but I know Linux and I want to automate my network
      -> Genie has a cli which uses the Python library in the backend to learn
         the network, compare and do task.

2) I dont know much python, but I would like to start with automation
      -> [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org) is a great introduction to
         automation. We've created a library for you to get started with Network
         automation.
    
3) I want to automate with Python. This gives the most power and flexibility.
      -> pyATS and Genie are ready for you! pyATS is a testframework which allow
         to run scripts and Genie is all you need to get your Network test Automation.


This training scenario is for the RobotFramework Library.


Genie is a Python library solution for PyATS which contains all the tools
needed for Network Test Automation. Genie bundled with the modular architecture
of the PyATS framework accelerates and simplifies development of network test
automation, while leveraging all the perks of the Python programming language
and promoting the development of agnostic libraries. Genie is redefining how
network test scripters interact with devices through libraries and avoiding
functional programming.

Genie is used internally within Cisco for automating network testing and has
also been released externally through Cisco DevNet. This means that the same
tests which are used internally at Cisco during product development can also be
executed externally on a customer setup. This is massive news for automation
within and outside of Cisco!


## Objectives

In this learning lab you are going to learn:

* How to use Genie Robot Library
* Take snapshot of your devices and compare them to see what has changed
